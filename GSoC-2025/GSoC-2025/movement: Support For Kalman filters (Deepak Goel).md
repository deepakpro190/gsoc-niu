Project Proposal

Synopsis

This project aims to enhance the Movement library by integrating an optimized multi-object tracking system that ensures accurate position, velocity, and acceleration smoothing, while effectively handling identity switches in Multi-Animal Tracking.
At its core, the system will utilize an advanced Kalman Filter framework, rigorously benchmarked to select the most efficient configuration for the Movement dataset. To ensure robust and reliable tracking, the implementation will incorporate state-of-the-art identity association techniques, including:
‚Ä¢	Mahalanobis Distance & Hungarian Algorithm for optimal detection-to-track assignment, minimizing incorrect identity associations.
‚Ä¢	Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) to enhance stability in complex scenarios, where multiple animals interact or occlusions occur.
‚Ä¢	Re-Identification (Re-ID) with Deep Learning to extract deep feature embeddings from animal appearances, ensuring long-term identity tracking.
To further improve decision-making, the tracking pipeline will compute a dynamic confidence score for each frame, integrating:
‚Ä¢	Motion Consistency Score, derived from Kalman Filter-based trajectory predictions.
‚Ä¢	Appearance Similarity Score, leveraging deep CNN feature embeddings for Re-ID.
‚Ä¢	Final Fusion Score, a weighted combination of motion and appearance cues for robust identity resolution.
By the project's completion, the Movement library will feature a highly accurate, AI-powered multi-animal tracking pipeline capable of handling occlusions, identity switches, and non-linear motion. This will provide researchers and developers with a scalable, efficient, and reliable tracking system, tailored for biological movement analysis, behavioral studies, and large-scale multi-animal research.
